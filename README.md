# gh-wt

A GitHub CLI extension that makes `git worktree` simple, with the state of every worktree and pull request at a glance.

[日本語](README.ja.md)

## Usage

``` console
$ gh wt                              # Select a worktree and move to it
$ gh wt -l                           # List all worktrees
$ gh wt <branch|worktree|path>       # Switch to worktree (create worktree/branch if needed)
$ gh wt <branch> <start-point>       # Create worktree with a new branch from <start-point>
$ gh wt -b <branch> <worktree>       # Create worktree with a different branch name
$ gh wt --orphan <branch|worktree>   # Create worktree with a new orphan branch
$ gh wt -p                           # Select an open pull request and open it in a worktree
$ gh wt -p <number|url|branch>       # Open a pull request in a worktree
$ gh wt -d <branch|worktree|path>... # Delete worktree and branch (safe)
$ gh wt -D <branch|worktree|path>... # Force delete worktree and branch
$ gh wt -m [<old>] <new>             # Rename worktree directory and branch (safe)
$ gh wt -M [<old>] <new>             # Force rename (overwrite existing branch, allow moving locked worktrees)
```

The target can be specified as:
- **branch**: a git branch name — _eg._ `gh wt feature-branch`
- **worktree**: a directory name relative to [`wt.basedir`](#wtbasedir) (default `.wt`) — _eg._ `gh wt some-worktree-folder-name`
- **path**: a filesystem path (absolute or relative to the current working directory) to an existing worktree — _eg._ `gh wt ../sibling`, `gh wt /absolute/path`

Targets are matched in that order: a branch first, then a directory under `wt.basedir`, then a path.

> [!NOTE]
> gh-wt has no subcommands. The first non-flag argument is always a target name, never a command, so `gh wt list` creates a worktree named `list` instead of listing anything. Run `gh wt -l` to list worktrees.

gh-wt follows [k1LoW/git-wt](https://github.com/k1LoW/git-wt): the same target rules, the same `wt.*` git config keys (except [these](#not-supported-yet)) and the same behaviour for the operations it has, built on `git` and `gh` alone. Where git or gh already does something, gh-wt runs it and shows its output as is.

### Listing worktrees

`gh wt` shows the other worktrees and moves you to the one you pick; `gh wt -l` prints the same table for all of them.

| Column      | Content                                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BRANCH      | Branch name (up to 28 cells), or `(detached)`                                           |
| CHANGES     | `↑` ahead / `↓` behind upstream, `!` conflicts, `+` staged, `~` modified, `?` untracked |
| PR          | Number and state (open / draft / merged / closed) of the branch's PR, an open one first |
| LAST COMMIT | Subject and relative time                                                               |
| PATH        | Worktree path, `~` for home                                                             |

- For a branch with an open PR, `↓` also counts commits pushed to the PR that the worktree doesn't have yet, without fetching. `↓N` means there are such commits, but they haven't been fetched, so they can't be counted.
- In the picker, the current worktree is shown grayed out under the header and can't be selected.
- When the table is wider than the terminal, PATH, the commit subject and BRANCH are shortened, in that order.

### Creating worktrees

When no worktree matches, `gh wt <branch>` runs `git worktree add` under `wt.basedir`. It checks out the local branch, or a remote branch of that name with tracking, or creates a new branch from `HEAD`.

Give a start point to create the new branch from somewhere other than `HEAD`:

``` console
$ gh wt fix/y main
```

A start point that exists only on a remote is used as `<remote>/<start-point>` (`checkout.defaultRemote` picks between remotes), so the new branch keeps its own name. A start point only applies to a new branch: it is refused when the worktree or the local branch already exists.

Use `-b`/`--branch` to give the branch a different name from the worktree directory:

``` console
$ gh wt -b user/my-feature my-feature
```

You can later switch to the worktree by either branch name or directory name:

``` console
$ gh wt user/my-feature  # switch by branch name
$ gh wt my-feature       # switch by directory name
```

Use `--orphan` to create a worktree with a new orphan branch, which has no history and starts from an empty working tree:

``` console
$ gh wt --orphan gh-pages
```

- It can be combined with `-b`, but not with a start point, and git refuses it when the local branch already exists.
- No files are copied into the new worktree, so that it starts clean. Hooks still run.

Flags may come before or after the names. `-b` also takes `--branch=NAME` or `-bNAME`, and `--` ends the flags.

### Opening pull requests

`gh wt -p` lists the repository's open pull requests, including ones from forks, and opens the selected one in a worktree. Like `gh wt <branch>`, it moves to the worktree if there is one and creates it otherwise.

``` console
$ gh wt -p          # select from the list
$ gh wt -p 1720     # or #1720, the PR's URL, or its branch
```

| Column   | Content                                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WORKTREE | The worktree's CHANGES if it exists (selecting moves there); empty otherwise |
| PR       | Number, green for open and yellow `draft` for drafts                         |
| TITLE    | PR title, shortened first when the table is wider than the terminal          |
| BRANCH   | Head branch                                                                  |
| AUTHOR   | PR author                                                                    |
| UPDATED  | When the PR was last updated                                                 |

The checkout is `gh pr checkout --worktree`, so the PR opens just as gh opens it:

- The PR is fetched first. Plain `gh wt <branch>` doesn't fetch.
- The new branch tracks the PR's branch, and an existing branch is fast-forwarded (or refused when it can't be).
- A fork's branch named like the default branch gets gh's `<owner>/<branch>` name.
- A URL of another repository's PR fetches that PR, as `gh pr checkout <url>` does.

gh-wt adds only the path under `wt.basedir`, and for a new worktree, the file copies and `wt.hook`.

### Deleting worktrees

When deleting, the same target types apply: `gh wt -d feature-branch`, `gh wt -d .`, `gh wt -d ../sibling`. Several targets can be given at once; processing stops at the first one that fails.

`-d` is the safe form and stops short when something would be lost:

- If the worktree has modified or untracked files, nothing is deleted. Ignored files such as `node_modules` don't count.
- If the branch is not fully merged, the worktree is removed but the branch is kept. git explains why and gh-wt still exits `0`, so read the message rather than only the exit code.

`-D` skips both checks and removes the worktree together with its branch.

- A target with no worktree but a local branch deletes just the branch (except a protected one, see below).
- A worktree whose directory was already removed is cleaned up as well.
- Parent directories left empty under `wt.basedir` (e.g. `feat/` after deleting `feat/x`) are removed.
- When the current worktree is deleted, the shell integration moves you to the main repository.

### Renaming worktrees

Use `-m` (`-M` to force) to rename a worktree's directory and branch in a single operation. With one argument, the current worktree is renamed; with two, an explicit worktree is renamed:

``` console
$ gh wt -m new-name                 # rename the current worktree to "new-name"
$ gh wt -m old-name new-name        # rename worktree "old-name" to "new-name"
```

- The directory moves to `<wt.basedir>/<new-name>`.
- The branch is renamed first, so git refuses invalid or conflicting names before anything on disk changes. If the directory then fails to move, the branch is renamed back.
- An existing destination, or a destination inside another worktree, stops the rename.
- `-M` overwrites an existing branch of the new name and moves a locked worktree.
- Parent directories left empty under `wt.basedir` (e.g. `feat/` after renaming `feat/x`) are removed.

When invoked through the shell integration on the current worktree, the shell function `cd`s to the new path (the same way `-d` returns to the main repository after deleting the current worktree).

> [!NOTE]
> The default branch and the branch the main repository's `HEAD` points to are protected.
> - `-d`/`-D` remove their worktrees but keep the branches, and refuse a branch that has no worktree.
> - `-m`/`-M` refuses to rename them.
> - The main working tree and detached worktrees can't be renamed either.
>
> The default branch is `origin/HEAD`, else `init.defaultBranch`, else `master`.

## Install

You need the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), installed and authenticated, and a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) in your terminal.

``` console
$ gh extension install meltin/gh-wt
```

## Shell Integration

An extension runs as a child process, so it can't change your shell's directory. Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` to move into the worktree:

``` zsh
eval "$(gh wt --init zsh)"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The shell integration creates a `gh()` wrapper function to enable automatic directory switching with `gh wt <branch>`. This wrapper intercepts only `gh wt` commands and passes all other gh commands through unchanged. If you have other tools or customizations that also wrap the `gh` command, there may be conflicts.

The `cd` is performed by that wrapper function, so it only exists in a shell that ran the line above. The extension itself always prints the resulting worktree path as the **last line of stdout**, which is what the wrapper reads. git's and gh's own output and [hook](#wthook) output all go to stderr, so scripts, editors and other tools can rely on the last line:

``` console
$ WT=$(gh wt feature-branch | tail -1)
$ git -C "$WT" status
```

- The exit status is passed through. If a hook fails after creating a worktree, you are still moved into it and the status is non-zero.
- `gh wt -l`, `gh wt -h`/`--help` and `gh wt --init` run directly, keeping colors and the terminal width.
- Put the line after `gh` is on your `PATH`. It replaces any `gh` function defined before it, and works with a `gh` alias and `setopt nounset`.
- Upgrading gh-wt updates the function the next time you open a shell. Run `gh wt --init zsh` to read it.

## Configuration

Configuration is done via `git config`, with the same keys as git-wt, so an existing git-wt setup keeps working.

#### `wt.basedir`

Worktree base directory.

``` console
$ git config wt.basedir "../{gitroot}-worktrees"
```

Supported template variables:
- `{gitroot}`: repository root directory name

A relative path is under the repository, and `~` is your home directory.

Default: `.wt`

#### `wt.copyignored`

Copy files ignored by `.gitignore` (e.g., `.env`) to new worktrees.

``` console
$ git config wt.copyignored true
```

Default: `false`

#### `wt.copyuntracked`

Copy untracked files (not yet added to git) to new worktrees.

``` console
$ git config wt.copyuntracked true
```

Default: `false`

#### `wt.copymodified`

Copy modified files (tracked but with uncommitted changes) to new worktrees.

``` console
$ git config wt.copymodified true
```

Default: `false`

> [!NOTE]
> - Files are copied from the worktree you run gh-wt in. The worktree base directory (`wt.basedir`) is always excluded.
> - On macOS, files are cloned with `cp -c` (APFS copy-on-write), so large directories such as `node_modules` copy quickly.

#### `wt.hook`

Commands to run after creating a new worktree. Hooks run in the new worktree directory.

``` console
$ git config --add wt.hook "npm install"
$ git config --add wt.hook "go generate ./..."
```

> [!NOTE]
> - Hooks only run when **creating** a new worktree, not when switching to an existing one.
> - If a hook fails, the remaining hooks are skipped and `gh wt` exits with an error. The worktree has already been created at that point, so the shell integration still `cd`s into it, and the non-zero exit code stays visible to scripts.
> - Hooks run through `sh -c`, so a hook whose failure should be tolerated can be written as `git config --add wt.hook "direnv allow || true"`.

#### Not supported yet

`wt.copy`, `wt.nocopy`, `wt.symlink`, `wt.deletehook`, `wt.remover`, `wt.nocd`, `wt.relative` and git-wt's per-invocation flags (`--basedir`, `--copyignored`, ...) are not supported yet ([#3](https://github.com/meltin/gh-wt/issues/3)).
